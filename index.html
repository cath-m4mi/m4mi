<p>When it comes to putting music to a poem, I find it very difficult as how i interoperate them can change on a daily basis, and as an ongoing project my ideas kept changing. I went with the 3rd poem extract, which to me screamed out space. I created two sections rather than maintaining one, as I feel like completely dedicating the track to a trance genre could be boring, especially without any visuals to add to it to create a completely immersive sound. with a slight edge of unease, much how like being in space would be! I’d like to think that the silence and the significant increase in volume of the second section symbolises a potential run in with danger, and the abrupt ending leads to the listener being able to make up their own mind.</p>

<p>This composition was incredibly fun to create, and really let me explore the use of my main instrument - percussion. I felt that a mix of tuned percussion (vibraphone, marimba and glockenspiel) fitted perfectly to create a magical vibe that the lights really portray. Personally, I found the lights reminded me of the idea of fairies, that are there but do not particularly want to be seen. I decided that the movement of light could portray either volume or pitch, so I decided that I would wait and see how the composition unfolded and as I came to significant light changes, I decided what would be the best path to follow in terms of whether I would change pitch or volume so the changes can come across subtle as I felt that this fitted the flow of the music better.</p>

<p>Trying to connect the video with events in the track was incredibly difficult for this whist using Sibelius. Part of my inspiration for this piece of music was a piece of music called ‘Foundry’ by John Mackey. It is a wind band piece based on a steel work, which was a similar vibe that I got from this video. I went with a lot of brass, and a lot going on to mimic the constant movement and change in the video. In the second section, I used cymbals to mimic explosions as a lot of the news clips were symbolising war and chaos, and a lot of notes that didn’t seem to fit to create a feel of discomfort.</p>

<p>As an avid gamer, this track was really fun to create. I created a piece of music that had a medieval classical feel, but something not completely overwhelming to the game as the main focus of it should be aiding concentration. This meant a lot of repetition and nothing that might distract the player from what they were doing. I ran a poll that I sent to friends in the gaming community on what they would want from a game such as this, and listened to soundtracks from similar games such as Hearthstone to see how the music correlated with the gameplay. All were much as I expected. Something that fitted the era of the theme of the game (in this case medieval fantasy) without being over the top.</p>
